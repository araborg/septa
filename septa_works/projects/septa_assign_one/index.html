					<h2>RGB (Red, Green, Blue)</h2>

					<p>
						The RGB color model is widely used in web design and
						development. It represents colors as a combination of
						red, green, and blue color channels. Each channel can
						have a value between 0 and 255, indicating the intensity
						of that particular color. For example, rgb(255, 0, 0)
						represents pure red, while rgb(0, 255, 0) represents
						pure green, and so on.

					<h2>HEX Codes</h2>

					<p>
						HEX codes are another popular way to represent colors in
						CSS. A HEX code consists of a hash symbol (#) followed
						by six alphanumeric characters, which represent the
						intensity of the red, green, and blue color channels.
						For instance, #FF0000 represents pure red, and #00FF00
						represents pure green.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="hsl">
					<h2>HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)</h2>

					<p>
						HSL is a user friendly alternative to RGB. It represents
						colors based on their hue, saturation, and lightness.
						The hue value determines the color itself, while
						saturation represents the intensity or purity of the
						color. Lightness, on the other hand, determines the
						brightness of the color. HSL values are expressed as
						hsl(hue, saturation, lightness), where hue ranges from 0
						to 360, and saturation and lightness range from 0% to
						100%.
