# Introduction to JS

=====================

# What is JavaScript?

Definition:

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming
language primarily used to add interactivity to web
pages. It enables developers to create dynamic content
that can respond to user actions, such as clicks, input,
or mouse movements.

Role in Web Development:

JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web,
alongside HTML and CSS. While HTML provides the structure
and CSS handles the styling, JavaScript is responsible for
the behavior of web pages. It allows for the manipulation
of the Document Object Model (DOM), making it possible to
update content, validate forms, create animations, and much
more, without needing to reload the entire page.
