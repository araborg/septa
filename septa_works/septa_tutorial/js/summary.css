Introduction to JS
==================


1. What is JavaScript?

Definition:
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming
language primarily used to add interactivity to web
pages. It enables developers to create dynamic content
that can respond to user actions, such as clicks, input,
or mouse movements.

Role in Web Development:
JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web,
alongside HTML and CSS. While HTML provides the structure
and CSS handles the styling, JavaScript is responsible for
the behavior of web pages. It allows for the manipulation
of the Document Object Model (DOM), making it possible to
update content, validate forms, create animations, and much
more, without needing to reload the entire page.


2. Setting Up Your Development Environment

Introduction to Code Editors:
A code editor is a specialized text editor designed for writing
and editing code, offering features like syntax highlighting,
code completion, and debugging tools.

Popular code editors include Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Sublime
Text, Atom, and others.
Key Features of Browser Developer Tools:

Console: 
A command-line interface to interact with JavaScript, log
information using console.log(), and debug scripts.

Elements Panel: 
Allows inspection and modification of HTML and CSS in real-time, understanding the Document Object Model (DOM), and testing code
changes without editing source files.

Sources Panel: 
View, edit, and debug JavaScript files, set breakpoints, and step
through code execution.

Network Panel: 
Monitor network requests and analyze loading times to optimize
performance.
