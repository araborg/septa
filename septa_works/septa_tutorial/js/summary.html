<!-- 
A. Introduction to JS
=====================


1. What is JavaScript?

Definition:
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming
language primarily used to add interactivity to web
pages. It enables developers to create dynamic content
that can respond to user actions, such as clicks, 
input, or mouse movements.

Role in Web Development:
JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web,
alongside HTML and CSS. While HTML provides the 
structureand CSS handles the styling, JavaScript is 
responsible for the behavior of web pages. It allows 
for the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM),
making it possible to update content, validate forms, 
create animations, and much more, without needing to 
reload the entire page.


2. Setting Up Your Development Environment

Introduction to Code Editors:
A code editor is a specialized text editor designed 
for writing and editing code, offering features like 
syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging 
tools.

Popular code editors include Visual Studio Code (VS Code), 
Sublime Text, Atom, and others.

Key Features of Browser Developer Tools:
Console: 
A command-line interface to interact with JavaScript, log
information using console.log(), and debug scripts.

Elements Panel: 
Allows inspection and modification of HTML and CSS in real-time, 
understanding the Document Object Model (DOM), and testing code
changes without editing source files.

Sources Panel: 
View, edit, and debug JavaScript files, set breakpoints, and step
through code execution.

Network Panel: 
Monitor network requests and analyze loading times to optimize
performance.


3. JavaScript Basics

What Are Variables?
Variables are used to store data values in JavaScript. They 
act as containers that hold information that can be referenced 
and manipulated throughout your code.

Declaring Variables:
Variables in JavaScript can be declared using var, let, or const.

var: 
An older way to declare variables; 
function-scoped.

let: 
A modern way to declare variables; 
block-scoped.

const: 
Used to declare constants that cannot be reassigned; 
block-scoped.

Example:
var x = 10;      // Declares a variable x with value 10
let name = "Bob"; // Declares a block-scoped variable name 
with value "Bob"
const PI = 3.14; // Declares a constant PI with value 3.14

Data Types in JavaScript
Primitive Data Types:
String: 
Textual data enclosed in quotes (single or double).

Number: 
Numeric values (integers and floats).

Boolean: 
Represents true or false.

Undefined: 
A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

Null: 
Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

Symbol: 
Represents a unique and immutable value (introduced in ES6).

BigInt: 
For working with large integers.

Example of Data Types:

let age = 25;           // Number
let greeting = "Hello"; // String
let isStudent = false;  // Boolean
let city;               // Undefined
let salary = null;      // Null


Understanding Operators

Arithmetic Operators:
Perform basic mathematical operations.
+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Modulus (remainder)
** Exponentiation

Assignment Operators:
Assign values to variables.
= Assignment
+= Add and assign
-= Subtract and assign
*= Multiply and assign
/= Divide and assign

Comparison Operators:
Compare two values and return a Boolean (true or false).

== Equal to
=== Strictly equal (same value and type)
!= Not equal to
!== Strictly not equal
> Greater than
< Less than
>= Greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to

Logical Operators:
Combine multiple conditions.
&& Logical AND
|| Logical OR
! Logical NOT

Example of Using Operators:

let a = 10;
let b = 20;
let sum = a + b;           // 30 (Addition)
let isEqual = a == b;      // false (Comparison)
let bothTrue = (a < b) && (b > 15); // true (Logical)


Writing Simple Expressions and Statements

Expressions:
An expression is a combination of values, variables, and 
operators that produces a value.

Example:
let c = 5 * (2 + 3);  // c is assigned the value 25

Statements:
A statement is an instruction that performs an action.

Example:
let greeting = "Hello, World!"; // This is a statement


Introduction to Comments

Single-Line Comments:
Created using // at the beginning of the comment line.

Example:

// This is a single-line comment
let x = 10;  // This comment is at the end of a statement


Multi-Line Comments:
Created using /* to start and */ to end the comment block.

Example:

/* This is a
   multi-line comment */
let y = 20;

Best Practices for Writing Clean Code
Use Descriptive Variable Names:
Choose meaningful names that describe the purpose of the 
variable.

Example:
let totalPrice = 100;

Keep Code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
Avoid duplicating code by using functions or loops.

Comment Wisely:
Use comments to explain complex logic, but avoid 
over-commenting.

Consistent Indentation:
Properly indent code to enhance readability.

Avoid Global Variables:
Minimize the use of global variables to prevent conflicts.


4. Control Flow
is a fundamental concept in programming that determines the 
order in which statements and instructions are executed. In 
JavaScript, control flow allows you to make decisions, 
repeat tasks, and execute different blocks of code based on 
specific conditions. This lesson will explore the essential 
control flow structures in JavaScript: conditional statements 
and loops.

Conditional Statements
are the backbone of decision-making in JavaScript. They allow 
your program to execute certain code blocks only when specific 
conditions are met. The main types of conditional statements 
in JavaScript include if, else if, else, and switch.

if Statement
The if statement is the most basic form of conditional statement. 
It executes a block of code if the condition provided evaluates 
to true. If the condition is false, the code inside the if block 
is skipped.

Syntax:

if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if condition is true
}

Example:

let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
}

In this example, the condition age >= 18 is evaluated. Since the 
condition is true, the message "You are eligible to vote." is 
printed to the console.

else Statement
The else statement complements the if statement. It allows you 
to define a block of code that will execute if the if condition 
evaluates to false. This provides a fallback option when the 
initial condition isn't met.

Syntax:

if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if condition is false
}

Example:

let age = 16;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
    console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
}

Here, the condition age >= 18 is false, so the message "You 
are not eligible to vote." is printed.

else if Statement
The else if statement allows you to test multiple conditions 
in sequence. If the first if condition is false, the program 
checks the next else if condition, and so on. This is useful 
for handling more than two possible outcomes.

Syntax:

if (condition1) {
    // Code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if all conditions are false
}

Example:

let score = 75;

if (score >= 90) {
    console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
    console.log("Grade: B");
} else if (score >= 70) {
    console.log("Grade: C");
} else if (score >= 60) {
    console.log("Grade: D");
} else {
    console.log("Grade: F");
}

In this example, the else if chain checks the score 
variable against multiple thresholds. The first 
condition that evaluates to true dictates the output, 
so "Grade: C" is printed.

switch Statement
The switch statement is a more organized way to compare 
a variable against multiple values. It's often used when 
you have a single variable that needs to be compared 
against several different cases. Each case in a switch 
statement is followed by a colon and the code to execute. 
The break statement is used to exit the switch block 
once a matching case is found.

Syntax:

switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code to execute if expression === value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code to execute if expression === value2
        break;
        // Add more cases as needed
    default:
        // Code to execute if none of the cases match
}

Example:

let day = 3;
let dayName;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        dayName = "Sunday";
        break;

    case 2:
        dayName = "Monday";
        break;

    case 3:
        dayName = "Tuesday";
        break;

    case 4:
        dayName = "Wednesday";
        break;

    case 5:
        dayName = "Thursday";
        break;

    case 6:
        dayName = "Friday";
        break;

    case 7:
        dayName = "Saturday";
        break;

    default:
        dayName = "Invalid day";
}

console.log(dayName);

In this example, the day variable is compared against 
each case. Since day equals 3, the dayName is set to 
"Tuesday", and this value is printed to the console.
The default case handles any values that don't match 
the listed cases.

Looping Structures
Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times, 
epending on certain conditions. JavaScript provides three 
main types of loops: for, while, and do...while.

for Loop
The for loop is a powerful and flexible loop structure that 
is used when you know how many times you want to iterate over 
a block of code. It consists of three parts: initialization, 
condition, and increment/decrement.

Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // Code to be executed in each iteration
}

Example:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("Iteration number " + i);
}

In this example, the loop starts with i = 0 (initialization), 
runs as long as i < 5 (condition), and increments i by 1 after 
each iteration (i++). The loop will print the iteration number 
from 0 to 4.

while Loop
The while loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code 
as long as a specified condition remains true. Unlike the for 
loop, the while loop does not have a built-in counter, so you 
need to manage the loop's control variable manually.

Syntax:

while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed as long as condition is true
}

Example:

let i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
    console.log("Iteration number " + i);
    i++;
}

In this example, the loop runs as long as i < 5. The variable 
i is incremented with each iteration, printing numbers 0 to 4. 
The loop stops when i equals 5.

do...while Loop
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but with a 
key difference: it guarantees that the code block inside the 
loop is executed at least once, even if the condition is false 
from the start. This is because the condition is checked after 
the loop has run.

Syntax:

do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);


Example:

let i = 0;

do {
    console.log("Iteration number " + i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);

In this example, the loop will print numbers 0 to 4, just 
like the previous loops. However, even if i started with 
a value of 5, the loop would still execute once before 
checking the condition.

Breaking and Continuing Loops
JavaScript provides two special statements to control the 
flow of loops: break and continue.

break Statement
The break statement is used to exit a loop immediately, 
regardless of the loop's condition. This is useful when 
you need to stop the loop early based on a specific 
condition.

Example:

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) {
        break; // Exit the loop when i equals 5
    }
    console.log(i);
}

In this example, the loop will print numbers from 0 to 4. 
When i equals 5, the break statement terminates the loop, 
so the loop does not continue to 10.

continue Statement
The continue statement skips the current iteration of the 
loop and moves on to the next iteration. This is useful 
when you want to skip over certain values or conditions 
without stopping the loop entirely.

Example:

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) {
        continue; // Skip the iteration when i equals 5
    }
    console.log(i);
}

In this example, the loop prints numbers from 0 to 9, except 
for 5. When i equals 5, the continue statement causes the 
loop to skip that iteration, so 5 is not printed.


5. Functions

Functions are a foundational concept in JavaScript. They allow 
you to encapsulate blocks of code that can be reused throughout 
your program, making your code more modular, readable, and 
maintainable. In this lesson, we'll dive into defining functions, 
invoking them, using parameters and return values, and 
understanding the scope of variables within functions.

Defining and Invoking Functions

Defining a Function
A function in JavaScript is defined using the function keyword, 
followed by a name, a list of parameters (optional), and a block 
of code that the function will execute.

Syntax:

function functionName(parameters) {
    // Code to be executed
}

Example:

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}

In this example, we've defined a function named greet that, 
when called, will print "Hello, world!" to the console.

Invoking a Function
To execute the code within a function, you need to invoke 
(or call) the function by using its name followed by 
parentheses.

Example:

greet(); // Outputs: Hello, world!

Here, the greet function is invoked, and the message 
"Hello, world!" is printed to the console.

Function Parameters and Return Values

Parameters
Parameters are inputs that you can pass to a function to 
customize its behavior. They act as placeholders for the 
values that will be passed to the function when it is 
invoked.

Example:

function greetUser(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greetUser("Alice"); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!

In this example, the greetUser function accepts a parameter 
name and uses it to personalize the greeting.

Return Values
A function can also return a value to the code that called 
it, using the return statement. This allows the function to 
produce an output that can be stored in a variable or used 
in other parts of your program.

Example:

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

let sum = add(5, 3); // sum will be 8
console.log(sum); // Outputs: 8

Here, the add function takes two parameters, a and b, adds 
them together, and returns the result. The returned value 
is then stored in the variable sum.

Understanding Scope

Scope determines the visibility and accessibility of variables within different parts of your program. JavaScript has two main types of scope: local and global.

Local Scope

A variable declared inside a function has local scope, meaning it is only accessible within that function.

Example:

function multiply(x, y) {
  let result = x * y;
  return result;
}

console.log(result); // Error: result is not defined


In this example, the result variable is declared inside the multiply function, so it is not accessible outside the function.

Global Scope

A variable declared outside any function has global scope, meaning it is accessible throughout your entire program.

Example:

let globalVar = "I am global";

function showGlobalVar() {
  console.log(globalVar);
}

showGlobalVar(); // Outputs: I am global


Here, globalVar is accessible both inside and outside the showGlobalVar function because it is globally scoped.

Best Practices for Writing Functions





Keep functions small and focused: Each function should perform a single task or a small set of closely related tasks. This makes your functions easier to understand, test, and reuse.



Use meaningful names: Function names should clearly describe what the function does. This makes your code more readable.



Avoid side effects: Functions should avoid modifying variables or states outside their scope unless absolutely necessary. This reduces unintended consequences and bugs.



Document your functions: Include comments or documentation to explain what each function does, what parameters it takes, and what it returns.

By mastering functions, you'll be able to write more efficient, modular, and maintainable JavaScript code. Functions are a powerful tool in your programming toolbox, and understanding them deeply will greatly enhance your ability to build complex applications.
