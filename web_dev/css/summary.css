A. Introduction to CSS:

What is CSS?
============

CSS defines how elements should be rendered on the 
screen, in print, or by other media. It allows
developers to style web pages independently from 
the structure, (HTML).

History and Evolution of CSS

CSS has evolved through various levels:
CSS1 (1996): The first official specification by 
the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It introduced 
basic styling features.

CSS2 (1998): Added new features like positioning, 
z-index, media types, and downloadable fonts.

CSS2.1 (2011): An update to CSS2 that refined and 
corrected the CSS2 specification.

CSS3 (Late 2000s-Present): Introduced modules allowing 
independent updates. Features include rounded corners, 
shadows, gradients, transitions, animations, and much 
more.

CSS4 (Ongoing): Rather than a single specification, 
CSS4 is more of a collection of modules that continue 
to evolve.

How CSS Integrates with HTML

CSS integrates with HTML in three main ways:
1. Inline CSS: 
Styles are applied directly to HTML elements 
using the style attribute. Example:

<p 
    style="color: blue; font-size: 14px;"
>
    This is a blue paragraph.
</p>

2. Internal CSS: 
Styles are defined within the <style> element in 
the <head> section of an HTML document. Example:

<head>
    <style>
        p {
            color: green;
            font-size: 16px;
        }
    </style>
</head>

3. External CSS: 
Styles are written in a separate CSS file and linked 
to an HTML document using the <link> element. This is 
the most preferred way as it keeps HTML and CSS separate. 
Example:

<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>


CSS Syntax Selectors Properties
===============================
CSS syntax is structured into three main parts:

Selector: Identifies the HTML element(s) to be styled.

Property: Specifies the aspect of the element to be 
styled (e.g., color, font-size, margin).

Value: Defines the style for the property.

The basic structure of a CSS rule is:

selector {
    property: value;
}

For example:

p {
    color: red;
    font-size: 16px;
}

This rule applies to all <p> elements, setting their 
text color to red and font size to 16 pixels.
