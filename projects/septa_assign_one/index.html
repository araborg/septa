				RGB (Red, Green, Blue) The RGB color model is widely used in web
				design and development. It represents colors as a combination of
				red, green, and blue color channels. Each channel can have a
				value between 0 and 255, indicating the intensity of that
				particular color. For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) represents pure
				red, while rgb(0, 255, 0) represents pure green, and so on. HEX
				Codes HEX codes are another popular way to represent colors in
				CSS. A HEX code consists of a hash symbol (#) followed by six
				alphanumeric characters, which represent the intensity of the
				red, green, and blue color channels. For instance, #FF0000
				represents pure red, and #00FF00 represents pure green. HSL
				(Hue, Saturation, Lightness) HSL is a user friendly alternative
				to RGB. It represents colors based on their hue, saturation, and
				lightness. The hue value determines the color itself, while
				saturation represents the intensity or purity of the color.
				Lightness, on the other hand, determines the brightness of the
				color. HSL values are expressed as hsl(hue, saturation,
				lightness), where hue ranges from 0 to 360, and saturation and
				lightness range from 0% to 100%.
